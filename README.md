The proposed SURGE project under Prof. Jayant K. Singh involves the computational aspects of phase transitions at the molecular level.  We propose the investigation of a nano-confined Lennard-Jones fluid.
Classical molecular dynamics is to be employed to study a system of nano-scale size, using the Massively parallel free and open-source software LAMMPS(Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator)  
To familiarise with LAMMPS, a waterbox was developed and equlibriated and RDFâ€™s were plotted for the system.    
This has been followed by the of reproduction of a paper based on the cooling rate dependence of crystallization for liquid copper.
We are dealing with the constant-pressure molecular dynamics simulations of Cu atoms to study the relationship between the resulting crystallization microstructure of the liquid copper and the cooling rate. Below the glass-forming critical cooling rate, the metastable hcp phase and the stable fcc phase can coexist in the resulting configuration with all sorts of proportion and various forms such as layering and phase separation.The sizes and the distributions of the two crystalline phases depend on the cooling rate: the faster the cooling rate the larger percents of the metastable hcp phase and the more easily the layering take place.
CNA is to be employed to achieve the distribution of  hcp-type and fcc-type polyhedra
The CNA is an algorithm to compute a fingerprint for pairs of atoms, which is designed to characterize the local structural environment. The CNA can be used as an effective filtering method to classify atoms in crystalline systems, with the goal to get a precise understanding of which atoms are associated with which phases, and which are associated with defects.
This shall be followed by study of the system under various shear rates. 
For different cooling rates, the nature of the distribution of hcp-fcc phases will be studied with variation in shear rates.
